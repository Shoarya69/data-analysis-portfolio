# 📊 Synthetic Data Generator

This project is a **customizable Python-based synthetic data generator** for simulating realistic datasets across domains like HR, sales, and education. It's designed to help data analysts, students, and learners practice data analysis, visualization, and machine learning without using real or sensitive data.

- Smart logic-based field dependencies (e.g., salary based on experience & department)
- User-defined row count and column selection
- Option to simulate current or historical date fields
- Export data directly to **Excel (.xlsx)**
